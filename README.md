# VFDDisplay
An Arduino library for [LGL Studio VFD Display](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802746106751.html) commonly found on Aliexpress

Big fan of retro tech, sadly Futaba and Itron doesn't make these anymore.

Library is highly simple and supports both 8 digit and 16 digit modules, basic usage can be found in `./examples`
